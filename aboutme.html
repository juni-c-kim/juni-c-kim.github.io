  <!-- About Me Section -->
      <div class="article-content about">
        <p>Exploring product management and marketing with my passion for narrative writing. In both fields, I believe in the power of storytelling to bridge gaps between ideas and people. </p>
        <p>I bring clarity to SAAS products through strategy, hands-on QAQC, crafting marketing copy, and thorough documentation. But, I’m most drawn to creating narratives that connect brands with their audience, turning technical complexity into digestible solutions.</p>
        <p>Attained a B.A. in Literary Journalism with a minor in Philosophy at UC Irvine. My studies there continue to inform how my writing explores hidden meanings and motives in people and place.</p>
