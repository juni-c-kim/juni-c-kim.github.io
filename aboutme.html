  <div class="article-content">
    <p>
      Exploring product management and marketing in tandem with my passion for narrative writing.
      In both fields, storytelling serves to bridge gaps between ideas and people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work at a digital marketing and tech solutions firm, which involves the improvement of SaaS products and workflows through strategy, testing,
      marketing copy, and documentation. I most enjoy helping to deploy complex ideas to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graduated from UC Irvine in 2024 with a B.A. in Literary Journalism and a minor in Philosophy.
      While there, my writing began to observe the hidden meanings, motifs, and motives in both people and place.
