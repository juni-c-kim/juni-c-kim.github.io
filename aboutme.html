        <p>
          Exploring product management and marketing in tandem with my passion for narrative writing.
          In both fields, storytelling serves to bridge gaps between ideas and people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work at a digital marketing and tech solutions firm, which involves the improvement of SaaS products and workflows through strategy, testing,
          marketing copy, and documentation. I most enjoy helping to deploy complex ideas to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graduated from UC Irvine in 2024 with a B.A. in Literary Journalism and a minor in Philosophy.
          While there, my writing began to observe the hidden meanings, motifs, and motives in both people and place.
