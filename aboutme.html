      <div class="article-content about">
        <p>Exploring product management and marketing with my passion for narrative writing. In both fields, storytelling serves bridge gaps between ideas and people. </p>
        <p>My day job involves making SAAS products better through strategy, testing, marketing copy, and documentation. What I enjoy most is helping to creatively convey complex ideas to users.</p>
        <p>Studied Literary Journalism with a minor in Philosophy at UC Irvine. My time spent there continues to inform how my writing observes hidden meaning and motive in both people and place.</p>
        <p>This website was made for fun with lots of AI tools.</p>
